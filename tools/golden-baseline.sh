# Capture a deterministic generation baseline, so a refactor of the runtime
# can be checked against byte-identical output rather than "the tests still
# pass". Phase 2 of the production audit needs this before RealForwardRunner
# is decomposed.
#
#   tools/golden-baseline.sh [4|8 ...]       # default: Ornith 8-bit
#   tools/golden-baseline.sh --check [...]   # compare against the stored file
#
# Determinism comes from greedy decoding: --temperature 0 with a fixed seed and
# a fixed prompt. Greedy means the sampler never draws, so the only inputs are
# the weights and the kernels — exactly what a runtime refactor must not change.
#
# SCOPE: a baseline is valid for one (machine, build, model) triple. Metal
# reduction order is not guaranteed across GPU families, so a file captured on
# an M3 is not a reference for an M4. Re-capture after a deliberate numerics
# change; a diff at any other time is a regression.
