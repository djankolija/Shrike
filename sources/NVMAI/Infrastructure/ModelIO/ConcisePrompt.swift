/// The prompts are derived from the Nail-Qwen3.6-35B-A3B chat template
/// (peculiar-ragdoll), which force-appends a terseness prompt to every
/// request. Measured on M3 24 GB, temp 0, 8 chat questions:
///
///   quant | baseline | concise (standard prompt)
///   ------+----------+---------------------------
///   4-bit |  3,788+  | 1,480 (−61%)
///   6-bit |  3,714+  | 1,680 (−55%)
///   8-bit |  3,635+  | 1,570 (−57%)
///
/// (`+` = baseline hit the 512-token cap). The standard prompt ships for
/// every quantization so behavior stays consistent across the family. An
/// experimental "strengthened" prompt measured 759 tokens (−79%) on 8-bit but
/// was judged too aggressive — it breaks cross-quant consistency and risks
/// dropping nuance on complex answers — so it is not shipped. See the wiki
/// FAQ and Optimization Journey for the full tables.

    You are in concise mode. Think before answering, then answer directly.
    Lead with the answer, then include only what the answer needs to be correct and usable.
    Never: open with preamble or pleasantries; restate the question; add filler transitions; hedge with niceties; repeat a point already made; or add a closing summary, follow-up offer, or 'let me know if you have questions' coda.
    Always: keep essential steps, caveats, uncertainties, and specifics — never drop correctness or a needed warning for brevity. Keep the final answer lean: use the least structure that conveys it (plain prose when short; lists or code only when they earn their place). If genuinely uncertain, say so and explain why — never omit uncertainty for brevity's sake.
    If a user request is genuinely ambiguous, ask one sharp question instead of guessing.
    When the answer is complete, stop — end with the answer itself.
